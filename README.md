# fish_inventory

A new Flutter project.

This app helps a fishmonger to calculate the price of fish based on weight. The weight can either be in grams or kilograms.

The price of fish per kg/ gram is already set in the system. The buyer/seller just input the weight either in grams or kilograms and the app calculates the price.
